          I design and build great digital experiences like websites and mobile
          applications. My strongest language is JavaScript, and my usual tools
          include Node.js, React.js, and GraphQL. Iâ€™d love to work with you on
          your next project, so feel free to reach out.

          I moved to Boulder, CO from Florida in 2018 after getting my degree in
          accounting at FSU and working for a few years in finance. I loved
          being creative too much to stick with just numbers, now I've combined
          my love of tech, numbers, and creativity into a career I love.
